# AbyssalBlocks

Combining AbyssalCraft with Lucky Blocks, what could possibly go wrong?

### Main Information

AbyssalBlocks is a Lucky Block spin-off where the rewards/punishments are based from things found in AbyssalCraft (or loot from vanilla loot tables). These random events are called Triggers, and the mod comes with 101 of them, and there's also a full API present that you can use to add your own Triggers! You can find the project at the following URL: http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/abyssalblocks

### Licensing

Right now the project is licensed as "All Rights Reserved", but that might change in the future. However, I can't stop you from using small bits of code, and the schematic loader code is borrowed from another mod, so that code (with a large amount of modification) is to be viewd as MIT licensed.

### Compiling and running

Since this isn't a complete environment, the last remaining pieces will need to be added to a folder (along with the build.gradle, build.properties and the src and libs folders). After that, simply open the folder in a command prompt and type gradle setupDecompWorkspace followed by either gradle eclipse or gradle idea (if you don't have gradle installed, use gradlew or gradlew.bat instead of gradle)

### Contributing

If you have ideas for a trigger or suggestions for present triggers (whether it is a specific trigger type, or a particular registered trigger), file an issue or even make a pull request (whilst providing information about the changes done in said pull request).
